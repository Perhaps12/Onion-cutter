Upload an image and the app generates a fake news article that goes along with it

Small project as an introduction to app development in python  
Learned about frontend/backend interactions & about different types of AI models  
Libraries used: streamlit, fastapi, transformers  
  
Uses image-to-text to get the caption for the image uploaded then uses text-to-text to generate the article based on the caption  
(nlpconnect for image-to-text and google flan t5 for text-to-text all for convenience)
